# successfactors-chrome-addon
An add-on for Chrome and compatible browsers to extract holiday data from SuccessFactors using an active session to generate absence data, and as a little add-on a birthday .ics and organisation chart. The tools were developed as a personal project to eliminate the need for double registration of holidays and to enable a complete view of holidays for a department.

Check out the README.md files in the `python` and `successfactors-chrome-addon`.
